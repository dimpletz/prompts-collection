# Create Implementation Plan

## Primary Directive

Your goal is to create a new implementation plan file for `${input:PlanPurpose}` that is specifically tailored for Jira requirement writing. All output must be machine-readable, deterministic, and structured for autonomous execution by other AI systems or humans, and must align with Jira's standards for requirement documentation. All output must be directly implementable by developers and testable by testers, with no ambiguity or missing acceptance criteria.

## Execution Context

This prompt is designed for AI-to-AI communication and automated processing. All instructions must be interpreted literally and executed systematically without human interpretation or clarification.

## Core Requirements

- Generate implementation plans that are fully executable by AI agents or humans
- Ensure all output is directly implementable by developers and testable by testers, with no ambiguity or missing acceptance criteria
- Use deterministic language with zero ambiguity
- Structure all content for automated parsing and execution
- Ensure complete self-containment with no external dependencies for understanding

## Plan Structure Requirements

Plans must consist of discrete, atomic phases containing executable tasks. Each phase must be independently processable by AI agents or humans without cross-phase dependencies unless explicitly declared.


## Phase Architecture

- Each phase must correspond to a discrete, independently deliverable Jira Epic or Story, with a clear summary and description.
- Each phase must have explicit, measurable acceptance criteria that can be directly mapped to Jira acceptance criteria fields.
- All tasks within a phase must be written as Jira Sub-tasks, with clear, actionable descriptions, specific file paths, function names, and exact implementation details.
- Dependencies between tasks must be explicitly declared using Jira's dependency linking conventions.
- All deliverables must be directly testable and verifiable, with no ambiguity or need for human interpretation.

## AI-Optimized Implementation Standards

- Use explicit, unambiguous language with zero interpretation required
- Structure all content as machine-parseable formats (tables, lists, structured data)
- Include specific file paths, line numbers, and exact code references where applicable
- Define all variables, constants, and configuration values explicitly
- Provide complete context within each task description
- Use standardized prefixes for all identifiers (REQ-, TASK-, etc.)
- Include validation criteria that can be automatically verified

## Output File Specifications

- Save requirement files in `/requirements/` directory
- Use naming convention: `<purpose>-<component>-<version>.md`
- Purpose prefixes: `user-story|bug|task|epic`
- Example: `user-story-auth-module-1.md`, `bug-payment-gateway-2.md`
- File must be valid Markdown with proper front matter structure


## Mandatory Template Structure

All requirements must strictly adhere to the following template, which is aligned with Jira user story and subtask conventions. Each section is required and must be populated with specific, actionable content. AI agents must validate template compliance before execution.


**User stories and subtasks must be saved as separate files, and grouped in the same directory.**

- Each user story and its subtasks must be placed in a dedicated folder under `/requirements/`.
- The folder name must be the user story ID and the user story title, separated by a hyphen (e.g., `US01-login-authentication`).
- The user story file must use a unique identifier (e.g., US01).
- Each subtask must be a separate file, named using the user story ID as a prefix and a subtask number (e.g., US01-1, US01-2, etc.).
- Subtask files must reference their parent user story ID.
**User stories and subtasks must be saved as separate files, and grouped in the same directory.**

- Each user story and its subtasks must be placed in a dedicated folder under `/requirements/`.
- The folder name must be the user story ID and the user story title, separated by a hyphen (e.g., `M2-US01-login-authentication`).
- The user story file must use a unique identifier prefixed with `M2-` (e.g., M2-US01).
- Each subtask must be a separate file, named using the user story ID as a prefix and a subtask number (e.g., M2-US01-1, M2-US01-2, etc.).
- Subtask files must reference their parent user story ID (e.g., parent_id: M2-US01).
- Bug IDs must be prefixed with `M2-` as well (e.g., M2-BUG01).

The status can be one of the following (status_color in brackets): `Completed` (bright green badge), `In progress` (yellow badge), `Planned` (blue badge), `Deprecated` (red badge), or `On Hold` (orange badge). It should also be displayed as a badge in the introduction section.
