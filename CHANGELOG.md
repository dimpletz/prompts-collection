# Changelog for Marketplace


## 1.17.0 - 2026-04-26

### Added
- ai-engineer plugin updated to v1.2.0 — adds `hook-maker` skill for creating VS Code Copilot agent hook configurations (`hooks.json` and companion shell/PowerShell scripts) for any lifecycle event (`SessionStart`, `SubagentStart`, `PostToolUse`)
- ai-engineer plugin updated to v1.2.0 — adds `plugin-maker` skill that scaffolds a complete VS Code Copilot agent plugin with the correct manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for hook-based plugins, `plugin/plugin.json` for skill/agent-only plugins), directory structure, README, and marketplace registration
- ai-engineer plugin updated to v1.2.0 — adds `marketplace-maker` skill that registers, synchronizes, and updates the project's plugins in the VS Code Chat Plugin Marketplace by keeping `marketplace.json` and the global `README.md` in sync with the actual plugin contents

### Changed
- ai-engineer plugin updated to v1.2.0 — plugin description updated to reflect the expanded scope (hooks, plugins, and marketplace management in addition to agents, skills, and custom instructions)

## 1.16.1 - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- learner plugin updated to v1.0.1 — `Topic Scriber` agent now auto-generates Mermaid diagrams immediately after a section is completed when the content would benefit from one, removing the previous confirmation prompt

## 1.16.0 - 2026-04-26

### Added
- learner plugin (v1.0.0) — adds `Topic Scriber` agent that guides learners through creating and updating personal study notes organised by topic; captures typed text, pasted content, and images then writes structured Markdown files with named sections, Mermaid diagrams, and a table of contents; one Markdown file per topic stored in a configurable notes directory
- learner plugin (v1.0.0) — adds `SessionStart` hook (`inject-learner-notes-dir`) that reads the `LEARNER_NOTES_DIR` environment variable and injects its value into the agent context so the Topic Scriber agent knows where to store notes without prompting

## 1.15.0 - 2026-04-21

### Added
- git-manager plugin updated to v1.3.0 — `git-diff-generator` skill adds `first_commit` source input that diffs the repository's very first (root) commit against Git's empty tree (`4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904`), producing a self-contained diff of everything introduced by the initial commit; no target branch is required for this source type

### Changed
- git-manager plugin updated to v1.3.0 — `git-diff-generator` skill makes `target_branch` optional when source is `first_commit` (not needed since the diff targets Git's empty tree)
- git-manager plugin updated to v1.3.0 — `git-diff-generator` skill now always generates a fresh diff file on every invocation and never reads or loads an existing diff file from the output directory unless the user explicitly requests it
- git-manager plugin updated to v1.3.0 — `git-diff-generator` skill uses `git rev-list --reverse HEAD | head -1` (or `Select-Object -First 1` on PowerShell) to reliably resolve the chronologically earliest ancestor reachable from `HEAD`

## 1.14.0 - 2026-04-21

### Added
- git-manager plugin updated to v1.2.0 — adds `git-diff-generator` skill that generates a `.diff` file comparing a source (pull request ID, currently checked-out branch, or remote branch) against a target branch using three-dot diff semantics; saves diff files to `GIT_DIFF_DIR` when set, otherwise to the current workspace root
- git-manager plugin updated to v1.2.0 — adds `SessionStart` and `SubagentStart` hooks (`inject-git-diff-dir`) that read the `GIT_DIFF_DIR` environment variable and inject its value into agent context

### Changed
- git-manager plugin updated to v1.2.0 — renames `pr-cloner` skill to `git-pr-cloner` for naming consistency; plugin manifest converted from `plugin/plugin.json` to hook-based `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- current-date-injector plugin updated to v1.3.0 — consolidates `inject-date` and `inject-time-command` into a single `inject-date` script that outputs both the date command hint and the time command hint as `additionalContext`

### Removed
- current-date-injector plugin updated to v1.3.0 — removes redundant `inject-time-command.ps1` and `inject-time-command.sh` scripts and their corresponding hook entries from `hooks.json`

## 1.13.0 - 2026-04-19

### Added
- python-user plugin (v1.0.0) with a `SessionStart` hook that injects `DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION` into the agent context (falling back to `3.14.4`) and a second `SessionStart` hook that detects whether Python is installed — if missing, injects a permission-request prompt instructing the agent to offer installation via the python-installer skill; includes the `python-installer` skill with cross-platform install scripts (`install-python.ps1` / `install-python.sh`) that download and install a specific Python version from the official FTP server
- poetry-user plugin (v1.0.0) with two `SessionStart` hooks: `inject-poetry-context` checks for a `poetry.lock` file and, if found, injects context instructing the agent to always prefer `poetry` commands (`poetry run`, `poetry add`, `poetry install`, `poetry update`, `poetry remove`); `check-poetry` also fires only when `poetry.lock` is detected — if Python is unavailable it injects "poetry requires python", if Poetry is not installed it attempts `pip install poetry` and injects either a success message (with a reminder to restart the terminal) or the pip error output
- poetry-user plugin — adds `vscode-poetry-configurator` skill that checks for an active Poetry virtual environment (running `poetry install` if none exists), then configures `.vscode/settings.json` with `python.defaultInterpreterPath` pointing to the venv's Python executable and `python.terminal.activateEnvironment: true` so all integrated PowerShell terminals automatically activate the environment

### Changed
- current-date-injector plugin updated to v1.2.0 — inject-date scripts now inject only the current date (YYYY-MM-DD), removing the time component
- current-date-injector plugin updated to v1.2.0 — adds `inject-time-command` hook (runs on both `SessionStart` and `SubagentStart`) that injects context describing the command to determine the current time in 24-hr format with timezone information (`(Get-Date).ToString('HH:mm:ss zzz')` on Windows / `date +"%H:%M:%S %Z"` on Linux/macOS)
- python-developer plugin updated to v1.3.0 — removed `SessionStart` hooks (`inject-python-version`, `check-python`) and `python-installer` skill; these have been moved to the new `python-user` plugin; the plugin now exclusively enforces code quality via the `PostToolUse` hook
- meeting-note-taker plugin updated to v1.1.2 — Workflow Step 1 now scans the user's initial prompt for any of the five setup values (subdirectory, filename prefix, meeting title, facilitators, attendees); pre-filled fields are shown with their inferred values for confirmation instead of asking the question from scratch

## 1.12.0 - 2026-04-18

### Added
- python-developer plugin updated to v1.2.0 — adds `python-installer` skill with cross-platform install scripts (`install-python.ps1` / `install-python.sh`) that download and install a specific Python version from the official FTP server

- python-developer plugin updated to v1.2.0 — adds `check-python` SessionStart hook that detects whether Python is installed and, if not, injects a permission-request prompt instructing the agent to offer installation via the python-installer skill

### Changed
- markdown-viewer plugin updated to v1.1.1 — install scripts now inject a concise "Python is required for markdown-viewer-app." message when Python is not detected on PATH, instead of the previous verbose install-instructions message
- current-date-injector plugin updated to v1.1.0 — hook scripts now inject both date (YYYY-MM-DD) and time (HH:mm:ss) as `additionalContext` so agents always know the current date and time
- meeting-note-taker plugin updated to v1.1.1 — inject-meeting-dir hook scripts now output `MEETING_DIR="<path>"` format instead of the previous `Meeting notes directory (MEETING_DIR): <path>` format

## 1.11.0 - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- meeting-note-taker plugin updated to v1.1.0 — Meeting Note Taker agent now collects facilitators and attendees during setup (two additional questions); adds optional `## Facilitators` and `## Attendees` sections to the output document; includes a `[TOC]` in the generated file; timestamps the date field with `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` format; renames the "Questions and Answers" section to "Q & A"; promotes all document body sections from H1 to H2; fixes a step-numbering bug in the capture workflow
- inject-meeting-dir.ps1 hook now wraps the resolved meeting directory path in quotes in the injected context output

## 1.10.0 - 2026-04-16

### Added
- meeting-note-taker plugin (v1.0.0) with a Meeting Note Taker agent that guides the user through structured meeting note capture; SessionStart hook that reads the `MEETING_DIR` environment variable (falling back to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\MeetingNotes` on Windows or `$HOME/Documents/MeetingNotes` on Linux/macOS) and injects the resolved path into the agent context; the agent collects notes interactively, analyzes them to produce a summary with optional Mermaid diagrams, an optional Q&A table (questions not answered are marked **UNANSWERED**), an optional actions checklist, and the verbatim original notes, then saves the document to a timestamped file under the configured directory

## 1.10.0 - 2026-04-16

### Added
- meeting-note-taker plugin (v1.0.0) with a Meeting Note Taker agent that guides the user through structured meeting note capture; SessionStart and SubagentStart hooks that read the `MEETING_DIR` environment variable (falling back to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\MeetingNotes` on Windows or `$HOME/Documents/MeetingNotes` on Linux/macOS) and inject the resolved path into the agent context; the agent collects notes interactively, analyzes them to produce a summary with optional Mermaid diagrams, an optional Q&A table (questions not answered are marked **UNANSWERED**), an optional actions checklist, and the verbatim original notes, then saves the document to a timestamped file under the configured directory

## 1.9.0 - 2026-04-13

### Add
- markdown-viewer plugin updated to v1.1.0 — adds `inject-mdview-params` SessionStart hook that reads `MDVIEW_BROWSER` and `MDVIEW_PORT` environment variables and injects preferred mdview parameters into the agent context; outputs nothing if neither variable is set

### Added
- markdown-viewer plugin (v1.0.0) with a SessionStart hook that installs `markdown-viewer-app` via pip when Python is available, and a Markdown Viewer skill that runs `mdview <file>` to open any markdown file in a browser with optional `--browser` and `-p` (port) parameters; notifies the user if Python is absent or installation fails; also handles stopping the background server on request

### Changed
- Merged developer-id-injector plugin into developer plugin (v1.1.0) — SessionStart and SubagentStart hooks that inject the developer name from the `DEVELOPER_NAME` environment variable are now part of the developer plugin
- developer plugin updated to v1.2.0 — developer name injector hook now supports `DEVELOPER_EMAIL` and `DEVELOPER_COUNTRY` environment variables in addition to `DEVELOPER_NAME`; any combination of the three variables can be set and only those that are present are injected into the agent context
